# Installation steps to support the 'roles-quotas' demo
To run this demo we need two supporting services for the demo:
* spark
* dcos-enterprise-cli (to support security examples)

The Spark framework installed has the 'sparky' role.

To confirm that everything has installed successfully, go to the cluster mesos page and then click on the 'Roles' menu option to confirm that the 'sparky' role exists.
